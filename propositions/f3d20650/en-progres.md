Sum of individual virtues (cf Dostoevsky). Opposes political constructivism. Progress is not progress if it does not make man more virtuous.

Democracy is not political progress, insofar as it sows the idolatry of consensus in men's hearts.

Conformism is a vice, and democracy elevates it to a virtue. In democracy, each man renounces seeking the good (virtue) and takes refuge in submission to consensus.

The same goes for truth. A democratic regime is a demagogic regime. Any commonly accepted idea becomes true.
