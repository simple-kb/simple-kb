Probability is a generalization.

It involves a general description of a propositional form. Only in default of certainty do we need probability.

If we are not completely acquainted with a fact, but know *something* about its form.

\(A proposition can, indeed, be an incomplete picture of a certain state of affairs, but it is always *a* complete picture.)

The probability proposition is, as it were, an extract from other propositions.
