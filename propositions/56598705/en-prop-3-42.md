Although a proposition may only determine one place in logical space, the whole logical space must already be given by it.

\(Otherwise denial, the logical sum, the logical product, etc., would always introduce new elements—in co-ordination.)

\(The logical scaffolding round the picture determines the logical space. The proposition reaches through the whole logical space.)
