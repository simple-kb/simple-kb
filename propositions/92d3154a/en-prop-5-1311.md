When we conclude from *p* ∨ *q* and \~*p* to *q* the relation between the forms of the propositions “*p* ∨ *q*” and “\~*p*” is here concealed by the method of symbolizing. But if we write, *e.g.* instead of “*p* ∨ *q*” “*p* \| *q* . \| . *p* \| *q*” and instead of “\~*p*” “*p* \| *p*” (*p* \| *q* = neither *p* nor *q*), then the inner connexion becomes obvious.

\(The fact that we can infer *fa* from (x)*fx* shows that generality is present also in the symbol “(*x*) . *fx*”.)
