In a free world, an individual sets up a pharmaceutical laboratory, then a clinic, then provides an effective treatment against cancer.

This individual treats millions of people.
Will this individual ruin himself by declaring his new property, with hundreds of kilometers of fencing and a security service?

It's unlikely. And if he does: who can assess that his property is illegitimate? Hasn't he generated a greater benefit by treating cancer? Then by paying cash on the nail for his real estate property?
Who can decide?
