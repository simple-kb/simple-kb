“\~*p*” is true if “*p*” is false. Therefore in the true proposition “\~*p*” “*p*” is a false proposition. How then can the stroke “\~” bring it into agreement with reality?

That which denies in “\~*p*” is however not “\~” but that which all signs of this notation, which deny *p*, have in common.

Hence the common rule according to which “\~*p*”, “\~\~\~*p*”, “\~*p* ∨ *\~p*”, “\~*p* . \~*p*”, etc. etc. (to infinity) are constructed. And this which is common to them all mirrors denial.
