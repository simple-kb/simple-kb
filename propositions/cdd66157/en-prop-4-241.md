If I use two signs with one and the same meaning, I express this by putting between them the sign “=”.

“*a* = *b*” means then, that the sign “*a*” is replaceable by the sign “*b*”.

\(If I introduce by an equation a new sign “*b*”, by determining that it shall replace a previously known sign “*a*”, I write the equation—definition—(like Russell) in the form “*a* = *b* Def.”. A definition is a symbolic rule.)
