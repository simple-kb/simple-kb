That *e.g.* the propositions “*p*” and “\~*p*” in the connexion “\~(*p* . \~*p*)” give a tautology shows that they contradict one another. That the propositions “*p* ⊃ *q*”, “*p*” and “*q*” connected together in the form “(*p* ⊃ *q*) . (*p*) : ⊃ : (*q*)” give a tautology shows that “*q*” follows from “*p*” and “*p* ⊃ *q*”. That “(*x*) . *fx* : ⊃ : *fa*” is a tautology shows that *fa* follows from (*x*) . *fx*, etc. etc.
