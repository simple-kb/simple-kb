We could say: What is common to all symbols, which assert both *p* and *q*, is the proposition “*p* . *q*”. What is common to all symbols, which assert either *p* or *q*, is the proposition “*p* ∨ *q*”.

And similarly we can say: Two propositions are opposed to one another when they have nothing in common with one another; and every proposition has only one negative, because there is only one proposition which lies altogether outside it.

Thus in Russell’s notation also it appears evident that “*q* : *p* ∨ *\~p*” says the same as “*q*”; that “*p* ∨ *\~p*” says nothing.
