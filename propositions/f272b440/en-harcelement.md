Where does harassment in the workplace come from?
Multiple factors surely.
One of them: the labor code.
An organization recruits an employee. Without making any serious mistakes, they still don't bring any value. The company doesn't have the means to pay them under these conditions.
The company wants to part ways with them... but it costs them (mutual termination: both parties must agree. And it's expensive. Dismissal is expensive)...
So their management will naturally become unpleasant... on a daily basis...
