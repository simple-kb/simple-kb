We regularly hear statements like:
"I think that self-checkout machines are good, because..."
Or:
"It's bad because..."

We find the same emotional stance in publications in pseudo-human sciences, disguised by protective jargon.

This kind of statement reveals a certain infantility: everyone positions themselves as a little constructivist or despot, in a position to decide (for everyone) how one should live in society.

The phenomenon of self-checkout machines goes far beyond the small despotic intentions of commentators...

What is the emotional stance?
"If I were in power, I would ban self-checkout machines... I would ban this, I would impose that"

Hence: socialism = authoritarianism

This kind of discourse leads to surprising contradictions like: "I am a Nazi and for freedom of expression"
