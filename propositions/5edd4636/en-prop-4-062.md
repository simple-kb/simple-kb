Can we not make ourselves understood by means of false propositions as hitherto with true ones, so long as we know that they are meant to be false? No! For a proposition is true, if what we assert by means of it is the case; and if by “*p*” we mean \~*p*, and what we mean is the case, then “*p*” in the new conception is true and not false.
