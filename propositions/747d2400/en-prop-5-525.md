It is not correct to render the proposition “(∃*x*) . *fx*”—as Russell does—in words “*fx* is *possible*”.

Certainty, possibility or impossibility of a state of affairs are not expressed by a proposition but by the fact that an expression is a tautology, a significant proposition or a contradiction.

That precedent to which one would always appeal, must be present in the symbol itself.
