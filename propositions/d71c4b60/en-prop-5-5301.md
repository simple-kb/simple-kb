That identity is not a relation between objects is obvious. This becomes very clear if, for example, one considers the proposition “(*x*) : *fx* . ⊃ . *x* = *a*”. What this proposition says is simply that *only* *a* satisfies the function *f*, and not that only such things satisfy the function *f* which have a certain relation to *a*.

One could of course say that in fact *only* *a* has this relation to *a* but in order to express this we should need the sign of identity itself.
