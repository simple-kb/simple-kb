Suppose in a schema like that above in No. [5.101](#5.101) *T~r~* is the number of the “T”’s in the proposition *r*, *T~rs~* the number of those “T”’s in the proposition *s*, which stand in the same columns as “T”’s of the proposition *r*; then the proposition *r* gives to the proposition *s* the probability *T*~*rs*~ : *T*~*r*~.
