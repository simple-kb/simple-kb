A property is internal if it is unthinkable that its object does not possess it.

\(This blue colour and that stand in the internal relation of brighter and darker eo ipso. It is unthinkable that *these* two objects should not stand in this relation.)

\(Here to the shifting use of the words “property” and “relation” there corresponds the shifting use of the word “object”.)
