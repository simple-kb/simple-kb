Thus e.g.

“

|p |q | |
|---|---|---|
|T|T |T |
|F|T |T |
|T|F | |
|F|F |T |

”

is a propositional sign.

\(Frege’s assertion sign “![{ \vdash }](images/8972055d3850ecff6e47e1516fc07474dfcc4bf7f0095ed9bcf5389c004a6d07.svg)\ ” is logically altogether meaningless; in Frege (and Russell) it only shows that these authors hold as true the propositions marked in this way.

“![{ \vdash }](images/8972055d3850ecff6e47e1516fc07474dfcc4bf7f0095ed9bcf5389c004a6d07.svg)\ ” belongs therefore to the propositions no more than does the number of the proposition. A proposition cannot possibly assert of itself that it is true.)

If the sequence of the truth-possibilities in the schema is once for all determined by a rule of combination, then the last column is by itself an expression of the truth-conditions. If we write this column as a row the propositional sign becomes: “(TT–T) (*p*, *q*)” or more plainly: “(TTFT) (*p*, *q*)”.

\(The number of places in the left-hand bracket is determined by the number of terms in the right-hand bracket.)
