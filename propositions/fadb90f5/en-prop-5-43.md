That from a fact *p* an infinite number of *others* should follow, namely \~\~*p*, \~\~\~\~*p* etc., is indeed hardly to be believed, and it is no less wonderful that the infinite number of propositions of logic (of mathematics) should follow from half a dozen “primitive propositions”.

But all propositions of logic say the same thing. That is, nothing.
