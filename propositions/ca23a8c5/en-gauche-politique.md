Relativist vision: Fabry Portal
Essentialist vision:
Rejection of Creation, distrust. For a leftist:
- others are not competent to be free. We cannot let them make their choices, dispose of their money, or even hear certain ideas.
We must therefore constitute a society in which certain (other) individuals will decide for them.
- Good and Evil depend on the modalities.
For example, stealing from someone is wrong, except if it takes place in a democratic modality (tax).
Another example, harming physical integrity is wrong, except if it takes place within the framework of health measures (forced vaccination)
This distrust thus unfolds into cosmopolitanism/collectivism (the two antagonistic poles of the left)...
