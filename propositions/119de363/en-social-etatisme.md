"The world of culture listens to and gives voice to the greatest number, sanctifies the freedom to think, act, create, love, and defends the idea that there is not just one identity but a thousand possibilities.

The world of culture fights against all injustices and violence, including within its own ranks.

The world of culture defends the necessity of a strong and independent public service as a guarantee of greater social justice.

Today, the world of culture, which our professional organizations represent, affirms with one voice, with strength and determination, that it will always stand against the temptations and outpourings of hatred, division and restriction of freedoms. It will do everything to prevent full powers from being left to those who have a restricted, petty and univocal vision of the nation's identity.

The Republic means caring for others, for everything that enriches humanity and its stories in their plurality.

To counter the far-right movements that threaten French democracy, given the social, ecological, and human perils they carry, facing the deadline of June 30th, the world of culture supports the union of all left-wing parties. This union is our most ardent hope so that our values of solidarity remain our country's compass.

"Fighting the far-right project must be combined with the emergence of social and ecological ruptures and the effectiveness of rights.

Together, we call for citizen mobilization.

See you starting Saturday to demonstrate everywhere in France."
