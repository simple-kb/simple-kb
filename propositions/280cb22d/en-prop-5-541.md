At first sight it appears as if there were also a different way in which one proposition could occur in another.

Especially in certain propositional forms of psychology, like “A thinks, that *p* is the case”, or “A thinks *p*”, etc.

Here it appears superficially as if the proposition *p* stood to the object A in a kind of relation.

\(And in modern epistemology (Russell, Moore, etc.) those propositions have been conceived in this way.)
