We can, for example, express what is common to all notations for the truth-functions as follows: It is common to them that they all, for example, *can be replaced* by the notations of “\~*p*” (“not *p*”) and “*p* ∨ *q*” (“*p* or *q*”).

\(Herewith is indicated the way in which a special possible notation can give us general information.)
