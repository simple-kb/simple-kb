A completely generalized proposition is like every other proposition composite. (This is shown by the fact that in “(∃*x*, *φ*) . *φx*” we must mention “*φ*” and “*x*” separately. Both stand independently in signifying relations to the world as in the ungeneralized proposition.)

A characteristic of a composite symbol: it has something in common with *other* symbols.
