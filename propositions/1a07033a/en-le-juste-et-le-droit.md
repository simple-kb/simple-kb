The law must be just.
The just must be made explicit.
(The term justice should not be qualified. We add "natural justice" in opposition to "social justice")

Making propositions explicit allows us to avoid sophisms or wild speculations.

We give ourselves the means to speak and contradict.



Object of this work... politics (left or right) seems nowadays to be reduced to imposing one's personal preferences on all fellow citizens.
Without ever asking what it is legitimate to impose or not, and on whom.

We are outraged at the idea that the state levies a tax on savings.
But we find it legitimate that the state levies a tax on work.
Why would our savings be more legitimate than our income? Is it not made up of our income?
Why / what grounds this condemnation?

This question is not trivial.
It is precisely because our value judgments are unfounded that we arrive at this situation.

It is because our conception of Justice is compromised / poorly explained that we end up here.

We have made so many concessions to power that it has no limits.
But how could we know? If our limits are not solidly defined?
