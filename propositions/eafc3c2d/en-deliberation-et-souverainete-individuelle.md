A deliberation cannot be the initial cause of a loss of [[Individual Sovereignty]] for an interlocutor.

A political deliberation cannot result in the loss of [[Individual Sovereignty]] of an innocent person.



The case of a trial is different. A trial can indeed result in a requirement of constraint for the guilty individual.
But in this case, the initial cause of this constraint is not the deliberation but the proven aggression.
