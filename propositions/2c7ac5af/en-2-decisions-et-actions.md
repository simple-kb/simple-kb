My decisions and my actions do not belong to another individual.
Reciprocally, the decisions and actions of others do not belong to me.

My person does not belong to another individual


A priori, in the absence of coercion, I cannot attribute to others the responsibility for my decisions and actions.

- If there is influence, manipulation, it means there is an influencer and someone influenced. A manipulator and someone manipulated. A liar and someone gullible.
- Faced with influence, or even an injunction, you can say yes or no. If the first time you say yes, you can say no the next time.
