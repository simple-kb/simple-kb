Propositions which have no truth-arguments in common with one another we call independent.

Two elementary propositions give to one another the probability ½.

If *p* follows from *q*, the proposition *q* gives to the proposition *p* the probability 1. The certainty of logical conclusion is a limiting case of probability.

\(Application to tautology and contradiction.)
