The Schemata No. [4.31](#4.31) are also significant, if “*p*”, “*q*”, “*r*”, etc. are not elementary propositions.

And it is easy to see that the propositional sign in No. [4.442](#4.442) expresses one truth-function of elementary propositions even when “*p*” and “*q*” are truth-functions of elementary propositions.
