Recognition of individuals. Everywhere and always, everything is a matter of individual conscience and morality. Behind every thought, every word and every act there is an individual.
Without an individual, there can be neither responsibility nor morality. There can be neither victim nor executioner. It is always an individual who suffers, never a collective abstraction.
It is always an individual who is judged.
