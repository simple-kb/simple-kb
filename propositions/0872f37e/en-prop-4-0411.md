If we tried, for example, to express what is expressed by “(*x*) . *fx*” by putting an index before *fx*, like: “Gen. *fx*”, it would not do, we should not know what was generalized. If we tried to show it by an index *g*, like: “*f*(*x~g~*)” it would not do—we should not know the scope of the generalization.

If we were to try it by introducing a mark in the argument places, like “(*G, G*) . *F*(*G, G*)”, it would not do—we could not determine the identity of the variables, etc.

All these ways of symbolizing are inadequate because they have not the necessary mathematical multiplicity.
