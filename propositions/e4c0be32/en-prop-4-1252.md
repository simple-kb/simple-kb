Series which are ordered by *internal* relations I call formal series.

The series of numbers is ordered not by an external, but by an internal relation.

Similarly the series of propositions “*aRb*”,

“(∃*x*) : *aRx* . *xRb*”,

“(∃*x,y*) : *aRx* . *xRy* . *yRb*”, etc.

\(If *b* stands in one of these relations to *a*, I call *b* a successor of *a*.)
