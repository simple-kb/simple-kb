If *p* follows from *q*, I can conclude from *q* to *p*; infer *p* from *q*.

The method of inference is to be understood from the two propositions alone.

Only they themselves can justify the inference.

Laws of inference, which—as in Frege and Russell—are to justify the conclusions, are senseless and would be superfluous.
