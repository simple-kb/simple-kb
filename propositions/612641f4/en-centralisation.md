Concentration of research, analysis, communication and decision-making.
The centralization of power operates notably through States and central banks.
The more centralized an organization is, the less effective it is. Indeed, each individual is best positioned to make their own choices.
Human societies implement such a large quantity of information that no authority can centralize all decisions efficiently.
The centralization of decisions suffers from another handicap: the absence of feedback. When an individual makes a bad decision, they suffer the consequences.
Each individual is therefore driven to seek the best decisions for themselves.
When a central authority makes a bad decision for an individual, it does not suffer the consequences. It is therefore not incentivized to improve.
Finally, decentralization allows individual genius to express itself. The multitude of decisions in a society will bring forth both good and bad ones.
A good decision will serve as an example, a bad decision will only impact the individual concerned. This virtuous phenomenon does not occur with a central authority.
The proliferation of individual choices is forbidden. A bad decision is imposed on everyone.
