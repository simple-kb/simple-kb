In order to recognize a tautology as such, we can, in cases in which no sign of generality occurs in the tautology, make use of the following intuitive method: I write instead of “*p*”, “*q*”, “*r*”, etc., “*T p F*”, “*T q F*”, “*T r F*”, etc. The truth-combinations I express by brackets, *e.g.*:

and the co-ordination of the truth or falsity of the whole proposition with the truth-combinations of the truth-arguments by lines in the following way:

This sign, for example, would therefore present the proposition “*p* ⊃ *q*”. Now I will proceed to inquire whether such a proposition as \~(*p* . \~*p*) (The Law of Contradiction) is a tautology. The form “\~*ξ*” is written in our notation
![](images/250px-TLP_6.1203c-en.png)\
the form “*ξ* . *η*” thus:—

Hence the proposition \~(*p* . \~*q*) runs thus:—
![](images/250px-TLP_6.1203e-en.png)\
If here we put “*p*” instead of “*q*” and examine the combination of the outermost T and F with the innermost, it is seen that the truth of the whole proposition is co-ordinated with *all* the truth-combinations of its argument, its falsity with none of the truth-combinations.
