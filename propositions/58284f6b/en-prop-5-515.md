It must be recognized in our symbols that what is connected by “∨”, “.”, etc., must be propositions.

And this is the case, for the symbols “*p*” and “*q*” presuppose “∨”, “*\~*”, etc. If the sign “*p*” in “*p* ∨ *q*” does not stand for a complex sign, then by itself it cannot have sense; but then also the signs “*p* ∨ *p*”, “*p* . *p*” etc. which have the same sense as “*p*” have no sense. If, however, “*p* ∨ *p*” has no sense, then also “*p* ∨ *q*” can have no sense.
