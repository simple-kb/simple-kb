Our choices, our decisions, our actions and inactions are not attributable to anyone other than ourselves.
* We are not "possessed" by someone else: our *thoughts* and our *words* do not belong to another individual.
* We are not or "piloted" by someone else: our *actions* do not belong to another individual.

Individual sovereignty is the "condition of self-ownership" of an individual.
