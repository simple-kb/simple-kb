If for example two propositions “*p*” and “*q*” give a tautology in the connexion “*p* ⊃ *q*”, then it is clear that “*q*” follows from “*p*”.

E.g. that “*q*” follows from “*p* ⊃ *q* . *p*” we see from these two propositions themselves, but we can also show it by combining them to “*p* ⊃ *q* . *p* : ⊃ : *q*” and then showing that this is a tautology.
