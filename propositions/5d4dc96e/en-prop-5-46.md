When we have rightly introduced the logical signs, the sense of all their combinations has been already introduced with them: therefore not only “*p* ∨ *q*” but also “\~(*p* ∨ \~*q*)”, etc. etc. We should then already have introduced the effect of all possible combinations of brackets; and it would then have become clear that the proper general primitive signs are not “*p* ∨ *q*”, “(∃*x*) . *fx*”, etc., but the most general form of their combinations.
