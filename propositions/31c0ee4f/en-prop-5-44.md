Truth-functions are not material functions.

If *e.g.* an affirmation can be produced by repeated denial, is the denial—in any sense—contained in the affirmation?

Does “\~\~*p*” deny \~*p*, or does it affirm *p*; or both?

The proposition “*\~\~p*” does not treat of denial as an object, but the possibility of denial is already prejudged in affirmation.

And if there was an object called “\~”, then “\~\~*p*” would have to say something other than “*p*”. For the one proposition would then treat of \~, the other would not.
