The expression of the agreement and disagreement with the truth-possibilities of the elementary-propositions expresses the truth-conditions of the proposition.

The proposition is the expression of its truth-conditions.

\(Frege has therefore quite rightly put them at the beginning, as explaining the signs of his logical symbolism. Only Frege’s explanation of the truth-concept is false: if “the true” and “the false” were real objects and the arguments in \~*p* etc., then the sense of \~*p* would by no means be determined by Frege’s determination.)
