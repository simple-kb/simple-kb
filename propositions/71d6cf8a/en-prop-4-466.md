To a definite logical combination of signs corresponds a definite logical combination of their meanings; *every arbitrary* combination only corresponds to the unconnected signs.

That is, propositions which are true for every state of affairs cannot be combinations of signs at all, for otherwise there could only correspond to them definite combinations of objects.

\(And to no logical combination corresponds *no* combination of the objects.)

Tautology and contradiction are the limiting cases of the combinations of symbols, namely their dissolution.
