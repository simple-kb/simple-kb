If *T~r~* is the number of the truth-grounds of the proposition “*r*”, *T~rs~* the number of those truth-grounds of the proposition “*s*” which are at the same time truth-grounds of “*r*”, then we call the ratio *T*~*rs*~ : *T*~*r*~ the measure of the *probability* which the proposition “*r*” gives to the proposition “*s*”.
