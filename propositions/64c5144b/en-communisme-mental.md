Any problem to be solved is "pooled".
The spontaneous reflex when faced with a question / problem is to make it a political subject.
The "retirement system" is an example. But there are plenty of others.
We never imagine letting people quietly decide for themselves.
We thus have an almost endless extension of the political field... with the sacrificial logic that accompanies it.
(Examples: public policies, coastal management...)
