First of all we must take note of the fact that all action is accomplished by individuals. A collective always acts through the intermediary of one or several individuals whose acts are attributed to the collective as their secondary source. It is the meaning that the acting individuals, and all those who are affected by their action, attribute to this action, which determines its character. It is the meaning that makes one action that of an individual, and another action that of the State or the municipality. (...) If we examine the meaning of the various actions accomplished by individuals, we must necessarily learn everything about the actions of the collective whole. For a collective has no existence and reality, other than the actions of the individual members. The life of a collective is lived in the actions of the individuals who constitute its body. There exists no conceivable social collective, which does not operate through the actions of some individual. The reality of a social entity consists in the fact that it directs and authorizes determined actions on the part of individuals. Thus the road to knowing collective wholes passes through the analysis of the actions of individuals.

As a thinking and acting being man emerges from his prehuman existence already a social being. The evolution of reason, language, and cooperation is the result of the same process; they were linked together in an indissociable and necessary way. But this process occurred in individuals. It consisted of changes in the behavior of individuals. There is no substance in which it could have occurred, other than individuals. There is no substrate for society, other than the actions of individuals.

The fact that there are nations, States and churches, that social cooperation exists in the division of labor, this fact becomes discernible only in the actions of certain individuals. No one has ever perceived a nation without perceiving its members. In this sense one can say that a social collective comes into existence by way of the actions of individuals. This does not mean that the individual is antecedent in time. This means only that it is defined actions of individuals that constitute the collective.

There is no need to discuss whether the collective is the sum resulting from the addition of its members or something more, whether it is a sui generis being, and whether or not it is reasonable to speak of its will, its plans, its objectives and actions, and to attribute to it a distinct "soul." This pedantic language is idle. A collective whole is a particular aspect of the actions of various individuals and, as such, a real thing that determines the course of events.

It is illusory to believe that it is possible to visualize collective wholes. They are never visible; the knowledge one can have of them comes from understanding the meaning that acting men attach to their acts. We can see a crowd, that is to say a multitude of people. As to whether this crowd is a simple gathering, or a mass (in the sense in which this term is employed in contemporary psychology), or an organized body or some other sort of social entity, this is a question whose answer depends on the understanding one can have of the significance that the assembled people attach to their presence. And this significance is always in the mind of individuals. It is not our senses, but our understanding — a mental process — that makes us recognize social entities.
