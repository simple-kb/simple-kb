The proposition shows what it says, the tautology and the contradiction that they say nothing.

The tautology has no truth-conditions, for it is unconditionally true; and the contradiction is on no condition true.

Tautology and contradiction are without sense.

\(I know, *e.g.* nothing about the weather, when I know that it rains or does not rain.)
