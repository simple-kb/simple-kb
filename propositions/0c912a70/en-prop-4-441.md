It is clear that to the complex of the signs “F” and “T” no object (or complex of objects) corresponds; any more than to horizontal and vertical lines or to brackets. There are no “logical objects”.

Something analogous holds of course for all signs, which express the same as the schemata of “T” and “F”.
