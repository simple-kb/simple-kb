If a notation is fixed, there is in it a rule according to which all the propositions denying *p* are constructed, a rule according to which all the propositions asserting *p* are constructed, a rule according to which all the propositions asserting *p* or *q* are constructed, and so on. These rules are equivalent to the symbols and in them their sense is mirrored.
