Without politics, there is no political lying
The French are lazy people waiting for this or that privilege granted by those in power.
And then they complain that the government lied to them.
This ugliness is evident during electoral periods. "Free shaves"... 50% of people live off the backs of others. Everyone hopes that political power will work in their favor... and they complain about being lied to!
